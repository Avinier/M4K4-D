# PCB-08 — Yaw junction

Stationary end of the clock spring: body-side power and signal connectors to the cassette FFCs (`J8-6`, `J8-7`).

**[D-093](../../decisions.md#d-093) scope (2026-11-06).** PCB-02 and PCB-03 are bought modules now, so the `W23a` (`J8-3`) and `W23b` (`J8-5`) permit and status cables and the D-082 `ARM_REQ` conductor are gone. PCB-08 **gains the yaw servo plug** that was PCB-03 `J3-5`: Feetech 5264-3P, 1 GND, 2 `+11V1_YAW` (from the bought yaw buck-boost, 11.1 V), 3 `SERVO_DATA` (from C2 through W43). It keeps `J8-1` (head power from the bought modules), `J8-4` (RS-422 head link, J9-1 order per D-092) and the `J8-6`/`J8-7` cassette FFCs. Reassign the freed W43 conductors at design.

## Log

Record dated entries: decisions raised, revisions, orders, bench results.

- **2026-11-06:** rescoped by [D-093](../../decisions.md#d-093): loses the `W23a`/`W23b` permit and status sideband and `ARM_REQ`; gains the yaw servo plug.
- **2026-11-07:** [D-095](../../decisions.md#d-095) CAD: the J8-3/J8-5 placeholders are removed and the yaw servo plug sits where J8-3 was, as a Feetech 5264-3P top-entry header (ID `J8-8` proposed) at X -9.5..0.4, Y -42.6..-36.85 on the board, mated plug above it to Z 126 (`PCB08_SERVO` in `final/v1/cad/makad-v1.step.py`; `check_pcb08_servo_plug.py` 5/5). Header body and plug are envelopes (E) until the footprint is chosen at design.
